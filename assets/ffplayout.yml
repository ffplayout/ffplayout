general:
    help_text: Sometimes it can happen, that a file is corrupt but still playable,
        this can produce an streaming error over all following files. The only way
        in this case is, to stop ffplayout and start it again. Here we only say when
        it stops, the starting process is in your hand. Best way is a systemd service
        on linux. 'stop_threshold' stop ffplayout, if it is async in time above this
        value. A number below 3 can cause unexpected errors.

        'mail_level' can be INFO, WARNING or ERROR. 'interval' means seconds until
        a new mail will be sended.

logging:
    help_text: If 'log_to_file' is true, log to file, when is false log to console.
        'backup_count' says how long log files will be saved in days. 'local_time' to
        false will set log timestamps to UTC. Path to /var/log/ only if you run this
        program as daemon. 'log_level' can be DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR.

processing:
    help_text: Default processing for all clips, to have them unique. Mode can be playlist
        or folder. 'aspect' must be a float number. 'logo' is only used if the path exist.
        'logo_scale' scale the logo to target size, leave it blank when no scaling
        is needed, format is 'width:height', for example '100:-1' for proportional
        scaling. With 'logo_opacity' logo can become transparent. With 'audio_tracks' it
        is possible to configure how many audio tracks should be processed. 'audio_channels'
        can be use, if audio has more channels then only stereo. With 'logo_filter'
        'overlay=W-w-12:12' you can modify the logo position. With 'use_loudnorm'
        you can activate single pass EBU R128 loudness normalization, 'loudnorm_ingest'
        allows normalization only on ingest stream. 'loud_*' can adjust the loudnorm filter.
        With 'custom_filter' it is possible, to apply further filters. The filter outputs
        should end with [c_v_out] for video filter, and [c_a_out] for audio filter.

playlist:

        'path' can be a path to a single file, or a directory. For directory put
        only the root folder, for example '/playlists', subdirectories are read by the
        script. Subdirectories needs this structure '/playlists/2018/01'. 'day_start'
        means at which time the playlist should start, leave day_start blank when playlist
        should always start at the begin. 'length' represent the target length from
        playlist, when is blank real length will not consider. 'infinit: true' works with
        single playlist file and loops it infinitely.
