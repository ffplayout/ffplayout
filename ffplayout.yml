general:
    helptext: Sometimes it can happen, that a file is corrupt but still playable,
        this can produce an streaming error over all following files. The only way
        in this case is, to stop ffplayout and start it again here we only say it
        can stop, the starting process is in your hand. Best way is a systemd serivce
        on linux. 'stop_threshold' stop ffplayout, if it is async in time above this
        value.

pre_process:
    helptext: Settings for the pre_process. All clips get prepared in that way,

        target size, leave it blank when no scaling is needed, format is 'number:number',
        for example '100:-1' for proportional scaling. With 'logo_opacity' logo can
        become transparent. With 'logo_filter' 'overlay=W-w-12:12' you can modify
        the logo position. With 'use_loudnorm' you can activate single pass EBU R128
        loudness normalization. 'loud_*' can adjust the loudnorm filter. 'output_count'
        sets the outputs for the filtering, > 1 gives the option to use the same filters
        for multiple outputs. This outputs can be taken in 'ffmpeg_param', names will be
        vout2, vout3; aout2, aout3 etc.
