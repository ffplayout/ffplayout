general:
    helptext: Sometimes it can happen, that a file is corrupt but still playable,
        this can produce an streaming error over all following files. The only way
        in this case is, to stop ffplayout and start it again. Here we only say when
        it stops, the starting process is in your hand. Best way is a systemd service
        on linux. 'stop_threshold' stop ffplayout, if it is async in time above this
        value. A number below 3 can cause unexpected errors.
    stop_threshold: 11

mail:
    helptext: Send error messages to email address, like missing playlist; invalid
        json format; missing clip path. Leave recipient blank, if you don't need this.
        'mail_level' can be WARNING or ERROR.

logging:
    helptext: Logging to file, if 'log_to_file' False log to console. 'backup_count'
        says how long log files will be saved in days. Path to /var/log/ only if you
        run this program as daemon. 'log_level' can be DEBUG, INFO, WARNING,
        ERROR. 'ffmpeg_level' can be INFO, WARNING, ERROR.
    log_to_file: true
    backup_count: 7

    log_level: "DEBUG"
    ffmpeg_level: "ERROR"

processing:
    helptext: Set playing mode, like playlist; folder, or you own custom one.
        Default processing, for all clips that they get prepared in that way,
        so the output is unique. 'aspect' must be a float number. 'logo' is only used
        if the path exist. 'logo_scale' scale the logo to target size, leave it blank
        when no scaling is needed, format is 'number:number', for example '100:-1'
        for proportional scaling. With 'logo_opacity' logo can become transparent.
        With 'logo_filter' 'overlay=W-w-12:12' you can modify the logo position.
        With 'use_loudnorm' you can activate single pass EBU R128 loudness normalization.
        'loud_*' can adjust the loudnorm filter. 'output_count' sets the outputs for
        the filtering, > 1 gives the option to use the same filters for multiple outputs.
        This outputs can be taken in 'stream_param', names will be vout2, vout3;
        aout2, aout2 etc.

ingest:
    helptext: Works not with direct hls output, it always needs full processing! Run a server
        for a ingest stream. This stream will override the normal streaming until is done.
        There is no authentication, this is up to you. The recommend way is to set address to localhost, stream to a local server with authentication and from there stream to this app.
    enable: false

playlist:
    helptext: >
        'path' can be a path to a single file, or a directory. For directory put
        only the root folder, for example '/playlists', subdirectories are read by the
        script. Subdirectories needs this structure '/playlists/2018/01'. 'day_start'
        means at which time the playlist should start, leave day_start blank when playlist
        should always start at the begin. 'length' represent the target length from
        playlist, when is blank real length will not consider. 'loop true' works with
        single playlist file and loops it infinitely.
    path: "/playlists"
    day_start: "5:59:25"
    length: "24:00:00"
    loop: false

storage:
    helptext: Play ordered or randomly files from path. 'filler_clip' is for fill
        the end to reach 24 hours, it will loop when is necessary. 'extensions' search
        only files with this extension. Set 'shuffle' to 'True' to pick files randomly.
    path: "/mediaStorage"

text:
    helptext: Overlay text in combination with libzmq for remote text manipulation.
        On windows fontfile path need to be like this 'C\:/WINDOWS/fonts/DejaVuSans.ttf'.
        In a standard environment the filter drawtext node is Parsed_drawtext_2.
        'over_pre' if True text will be overlay in pre processing. Continue same text
        over multiple files is in that mode not possible. 'text_from_filename' activate the
        extraction from text of a filename. With 'style' you can define the drawtext
        parameters like position, color, etc. Post Text over API will override this.
        With 'regex' you can format file names, to get a title from it.

out:
    helptext: The final playout compression. Set the settings to your needs.
        'mode' has the standard options 'desktop', 'hls', 'live_switch', 'stream'. Self made
        outputs can be define, by adding script in output folder with an 'output' function
        inside. 'preview' works only in streaming output and creates a separate preview stream.
